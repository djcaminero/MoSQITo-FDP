def ear_filter_design():
    """Return second-order filter coefficients of outer and middle/inner ear filter according to ECMA-418-2
    section 5.1.2.

    The first section psycho-acoustic hearing model of the Annex F corresponds to the signal filtering (*) done in the
    outer and middle ear.
    As it is described in the annex: "The filter is optimized  on the equal-loudness contours of ISO 226:2003 for
    frequencies higher than 1 kHz. For lower frequencies, the equal-loudness contours of ISO 226:1987 are chosen as
    target because there is a large uncertainty of the experimental data at low frequencies".
    We have to filter the signal with a high order filter (order = 8) (Formula 1), which is implemented as
    serially-cascaded second-order filters (digital biquad filter) with the recursive Formula 2. The coefficient for
    the filters are shown in Table 1. Each filter has its coefficients normalized to for having a0=1 on each one.
    Also, for the implementation of these filters, we decided to use "scipy.signal.sosfiltfilt", which takes the filter
    coefficients in "sos" format (**) and filters the signal twice times, once forward and once backwards. Consequently,
    the "sosfiltfilt" does not make possible to use this code in real-time situations, to change that use
    "scipy.signal.sosfilt" instead, which is a causal forward-in-time filter, with "sos" coefficients.

    (*) Filter coefficient values for the actual version of ECMA-74 (17th Edition/June 2019). Coefficients have changed
    from the previous version to the actual one.
    (**) sos format: b0, b1, b2, a0, a1, a2
